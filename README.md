# Simple application control system

SACS is **c++ Linux library** which gives you a fast solution
if you need to call parts of your code during application execution.
Once integrated you will have a two way communication between your project and 
interface provided trough a http web page. It's easiest to compare this to remote debugger
in Chromium based browser.
